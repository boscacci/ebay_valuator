{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1984 Peavey Horizon II It is a vintage black that has aged quite well. 24.75\" scale. Lots of good, honest play wear. I would describe it as a medium relic. Body has lots of scuffs, scratches, nicks and small dings. Some buckle rash on back. Guitar has seen a lot of use over its 30+ years. There are tiny and medium scuffs and Light to medium fret wear.Plenty of meat left on frets. Lots of tiny, shallow, fairly hard to feel guitar stand/play marks on back of neck. Headstock has some scuffs, scratches and nicks. Some nicks and scuffs around sides and edges. Electronics sound great. Tone knobs fade from humbucker to single coil before bleeding off the treble. They are outstanding pickups. Does not have tremolo bar. Nut is approximately 1.705\" wide (about 43mm). Guitar weighs (as shown in photos) 8 pounds, 12.8 ounces. An outstanding 30+ year old, quality USA made, fairly rare, honest relic warhorse that is truly undervalued in today's market. Vintage, USA made Peaveys are some of the most durable electric guitars ever made. Includes original Peavey hard case. The outside of the case is in very good condition however the the inside lining is missing. I will carefully wrap the guitar inside the case for shipping Shipping is for lower 48.
