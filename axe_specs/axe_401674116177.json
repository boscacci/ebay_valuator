{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Fender Classic Player '50s Stratocaster Electric Guitar Made in Japan w/ Case Condition: Good used condition, with some scuffs and scratches. Headstock has some minor dings and dents. Tuners, nut, neck, fretboard, and bridge are all in good condition. All the cracks seen on the body are just in the finish. There was some work done on the neck as the serial is partially missing where perhaps a repair was made. The neck plate is not original. There is an aftermarket Floyd Rose bridge and DiMarzio humbucker. Neck appears to be straight and action is even. The electronics were tested and seem to be working well, but this guitar has not been pushed to its limits. There is a truss rod in place. New strings will be required, and there is a case included. Measurements: Full Length: 39\" Lower Bout: 13\" Upper Bout: 11\" Nut to saddle: 25.5\" Notes: Please see photos for additional detail and feel free to ask questions.
