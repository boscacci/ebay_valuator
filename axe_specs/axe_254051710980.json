There are a couple of nicks and very limited buckle rash- Tuning pegs were changed (or repositioned?) at the factory- There was an additional bridge in the case, with tape marking it as for this guitar- Original Black Tolex case with silver hardware, black interior included- All original paperwork and contents of case are included- Aside for occasional restringing and cleaning, this guitar in as it was when it left the manufacturer Condition is excellent/very good. There are a couple of small nicks (see photos) but the condition, finish and hardware are otherwise excellent.Basic Singlecut info from PRS website (though this is not a standard-issue PRS, as noted):Singlecut body shape with carved maple top, mahogany back and neck, rosewood fretboard, 25\" scale length with 10\" fretboard radius, optional bird inlays, Wide Fat neck carve, two volume and two tone controls with 3-way toggle on upper bout. On Jan-06-19 at 07:03:31 PST, seller added the following information: Update, please read: Artist stock is PRS's instrument loaner program to artists.Premium Wood designations are: 10 top, artist grade, private stock.artist stock and wood library are not indications of wood qualityI received this info from an eBay member who seems more knowledgeable about PRS wood designations than I, so my claim of this being 'the best of their best' seems inaccurate. That said, it's a rare and beautiful guitar!
