{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a nice vintage mid 1980s warmoth neck and body flying V build with a rare 80s Schecter fine tune tremolo and locking nut. The tuners are stagg but the headstock is also predrilled for sperzel locking tuners . The pickups are 4 wire heavy wound and sound and look like seymour duncans . The trem bar hole is friction fit ... the bar is an after market replacement. It has a locking volm knob and 3way select switch. The neck is straight and true and the truss rod works as it should.The fretboard has a tiny chip at the 14th fret and the body has a little wear around the points as pictured but none of which affect playability.The mahogany lacquer is nice on the headstock but the body has runs here and there and isn\u2019t perfect . I don\u2019t have a back plate.This guitar plays and sounds awesome as is or would make a sweet vintage resto project. I only ship to the lower 48 states and since this item is as is...please!please! Ask any and all questions before you bid ! Thanks and happy bidding!", "ItemID": "123528237967", "EndTime": "2018-12-07T00:05:43.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-06T00:05:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Warmoth-guitar-Vintage-80s-Roads-Flying-V-Build-/123528237967", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Lake Placid, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235282379678080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/mQ4AAOSwXc9cBBhU/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ghwAAOSwzgtcBBhI/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/cNgAAOSwmOBcBBht/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TFMAAOSw3MhcBBhY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LXwAAOSwsqxcBBhl/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/DlAAAOSwe~lcBCrO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Qq0AAOSwJ7RcBBhi/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/R-wAAOSw1uVcBBhE/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wYcAAOSwBPRcBBhL/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/-P8AAOSwxG9cBBhp/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/YGgAAOSwZBRcBBjg/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/RbsAAOSwt0dcBBjj/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "12946", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "joepicker", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 338, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 200.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "m***8", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1478}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Warmoth guitar!
