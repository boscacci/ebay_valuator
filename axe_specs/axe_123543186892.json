Paste link into a browser window: [isdntekvideo] If you are like me, you like to see what you are getting, so I took lots of pics. Thanks for looking! Check out my other cool listings! About The Seller: I am a married dad of four kids. I quit my job three years ago to sell on eBay full time. My other job is pastoring a Church in Florida. I\u2019m not some large corporation, just a regular guy making his way for his family. I have a fun time exploring and finding things to sell on eBay. I scour estate sales, garages, attics and anywhere to find many unique and rare items. I jokingly say that I am a minister for \u201corphaned objects\u201d, finding them new homes where they will be used and enjoyed. Problems: Virtually everything I sell is previously owned, so I understand that sometimes problems may arise. Please do not open a case. Email me and I will work quickly to resolve it. Your satisfaction is important to me. Feedback: Your positive feedback is important and helpful to me. The stars count, too. eBay has changed how they calculate feedback. Anything less than five stars or neutral ends up working against my rating, so if you can, please leave a good rating. If there is a problem, please message me. I promise to always give you positive feedback. Shipping: I usually will use FedEx, but may use USPS if it is less expensive. Typical shipping days are Mondays and Thursdays. Please let me know if you need me to ship same or next day. I can usually accommodate when requested. Flat rate shipping does not apply to outside the Continental U.S., Puerto Rico, Alaska or Hawaii. P.O. Boxes may incur shipping surcharge. I only use eBay Global Shipping for international shipping. Shipping is not refundable on returns. Local pick up always available at no charge. Let me know and I will invoice you without the shipping charge. e e", "ItemID": "123543186892", "EndTime": "2019-01-25T12:35:39.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-13T22:02:33.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/ESP-LTD-Phoenix-200-Seymour-Duncan-Pick-Ups-Electric-Guitar-Thunderbird-N427-/123543186892", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Saint Petersburg, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1235431868928080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTM4MFgxMTg2/z/va0AAOSwvqVcEtU9/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xy8AAOSwa3lcEtRW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/kn0AAOSwYUZcEtRY/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jvEAAOSwwXRcEtRb/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VDkAAOSwwPdcEtRd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/plUAAOSwiwZcEtRg/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/VLkAAOSw-GNcEtRi/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/JmUAAOSwjNdcEtRl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/LgQAAOSwiwZcEtRn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/1IMAAOSwZBRcEtRp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nRYAAOSwV3dcEtRr/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dW4AAOSw-HRcEtRu/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "33710", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "revjoanna", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 2517, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.8, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 299.95, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***l", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 209}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US", "CA", "GB", "DK", "RO", "SK", "BG", "CZ", "FI", "HU", "LV", "LT", "MT", "EE", "AU", "GR", "PT", "CY", "SI", "JP", "CN", "SE", "KR", "ID", "TW", "TH", "BE", "FR", "HK", "IE", "NL", "PL", "ES", "IT", "DE", "AT", "BS", "IL", "MX", "NZ", "PH", "SG", "CH", "NO", "SA", "UA", "AE", "QA", "KW", "BH", "HR", "MY", "CL", "CO", "CR", "PA", "TT", "GT", "HN", "JM", "AG", "AW", "BZ", "DM", "GD", "KN", "LC", "MS", "TC", "BB", "BD", "BM", "BN", "BO", "EG", "GF", "GG", "GI", "GP", "IS", "JE", "JO", "KH", "KY", "LI", "LK", "LU", "MC", "MO", "MQ", "MV", "NI", "OM", "PK", "PY", "RE"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "ESP LTD Phoenix 200 Seymour Duncan Pick Ups Electric Guitar Thunderbird N427", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["ESP"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 689, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=223715740", "StoreName": "J&#39;s Cool Stuff"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": true, "ConditionDescription": "Has had some modifications.
