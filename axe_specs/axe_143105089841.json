Specs from the web: Built for speed and serious sustain, Jackson's Soloist SLXQ solidbody electric guitar gives you the performance of a traditional Jackson shredding machine for a fraction of the price. Featuring the clean lines and simple setup Soloist guitars are known for, the Soloist SLXQ lets you connect to your music and really focus on your technique. Its neck-through-body design gives you tons of sustain, and its compound-radius fingerboard lets you easily transition from solid riffing to high-throttle shredding. And with a gorgeous quilted maple veneer, the Jackson Soloist SLXQ looks as good as it performs. Jackson Soloist SLXQ Solidbody Electric Guitar at a Glance: High-performance design puts you in touch with your music Genuine Floyd Rose Special tailpiece An excellent set of EMG pickups High-performance design puts you in touch with your music One of Jackson's mottos is \"Choose wisely. Play better.\" That's not just hype either. The fact is, a well made guitar, like a Soloist SLXQ, gives you a closer connection to your music. For instance, the Soloist SLXQ features a compound radius fretboard, which is more rounded at the nut and flatter higher up the neck. This makes it easy to fret chords near the nut, while opening up the fretboard for soloing. The flatter higher frets also let you keep your action low, without bottoming out when you bend notes. And thanks to its neck-through-body design, the Soloist SLXQ also gives you epic sustain. Genuine Floyd Rose Special tailpiece In typical Jackson fashion, this incredible guitar was built with nothing but quality hardware onboard. That's why they gave the Soloist SLXQ guitar a real 2-point, double-locking Floyd Rose tremolo tailpiece. The light-weight Floyd Rose Special tremolo tailpiece gives you the real feel of an original Floyd Rose, adding to the Soloist SLXQ's amazingly responsive feel. An excellent set of EMG pickups Great feel is only part of the equation. Jackson knows this better than just about any guitar maker. That's why they've equipped the Soloist SLXQ with a set of extra-hot EMG humbucking pickups. An EMG H4-AN pickup at the neck and a H4-B at the bridge give you well-balanced tone with tight bass, glassy mids and crunching highs.
