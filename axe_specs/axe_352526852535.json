{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Here's a wonderful guitar that I've had for years. first things first the neck is a USA custom guitars custom neck 10 inch radius with 6150 frets and I believe it's a c shape. the body is a 2000 USA Fender Stratocaster with bridge and parts and pieces. All USA of USA stuff of that year the only thing that was not original is the pickguard. I do not know what the pickups are but I do know that they are good sounding vintage cloth wired pickups into a custom on off phase switching switches on the pickguard. There are hundreds of sounds on this guitar. The only thing of note that needs to be mentioned. Is that the guitar does have some scrapes on the bottom and also the guitar has been set up for super low action. That being said I did find that when picked hard that there was a bit of buzzing at the g-string and a little at the b I personally do finger-picking so I don't have to dig in too much and did not find that a problem but if you do pick hard that you will probably need to have a guitar reset up and make small adjustments here and there for your personal playing style. That being said it's a wonderful guitar. Also there is a tiny little paint crack near the neck pocket very common for stratocasters and last but not least it comes in a beautiful yellow skin snake case not really sure what the whereabouts of it is other than it's super cool made by Philz. Also the Frets are very nice on this guitar they are very tall with no dings or dents that I can see in the frets. So with that being said this guitar is somewhat of a parts guitar molded and put together. So for that reason she's being sold as is no returns. Please ask as many questions as possible I'll do my best to answer them. thank you for checking on my listing please ask as many questions as possible good luck and happy bidding.", "ItemID": "352526852535", "EndTime": "2018-12-02T20:15:29.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-11-25T20:15:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/2000-Fender-USA-American-body-Stratocaster-USACG-Maple-neck-us-parts-guitar-/352526852535", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Compton, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/3525268525358080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/MXkAAOSwn6Jb-v8y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NyUAAOSwsRVb-v9S/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iNIAAOSwrAFb-v9V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/u4QAAOSw-rxb-v9n/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FxcAAOSwPeVb-v9~/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/0RUAAOSwSlpb-v-a/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/u8UAAOSw-rxb-v-d/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/g8MAAOSwBkBb-v~n/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Z-gAAOSw~atb-v~q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/iSwAAOSwp7Rb-wAA/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ew4AAOSwAP9b-wAD/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/jLcAAOSwM5tb-wAF/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "90221", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "konstbog0", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 42, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 37, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 410.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 410.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "s***m", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "2000 Fender USA American body  Stratocaster USACG Maple neck us parts guitar ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Fingerboard", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Stratocaster Ash Crimson Red Transparent / Maple"]}, {"Name": "Neck", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Frets", "Value": ["22"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Ash"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Case", "Value": ["Soft case"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}]}, "HitCount": 806, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 415.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
