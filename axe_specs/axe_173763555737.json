{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Schecter Damien Elite 6 FR guitar in excellent, barely ever played condtion. This is a very nice guitar and very well made right next to PRS's in Korea. It has a great sound and a shredders action, and basically just hung on the wall as a decoration for a couple of years. I maybe played it twice. I'm just not a shredder type guitar player, and I have too many other axes that I prefer to play on. I thought maybe I'd try a shredder after trying my brother in law's Schecter and realizing how great these babies are in bang for buck! I payed top dollar and am selling it at a much lower price point so that someone who prefers to fly around the neck at great speed. You wont be dissapointed. These guitars are gorgeous! and the build quality is very high! This is truly a \"like new\" guitar. One tiny nick on the back near the plastic plate edge that houses the floyd rose tremelo. Which is another great feature that you get. It has a floyd rose tremolo built in! It even has some special electronics (EMG active module, adds crunch and volume) that requires a 9v battery, also on the back panel. Don't forget to make sure this battery is a good one when you get it. Plainly speaking this Schecter rocks! Really! USA ship only. Surcharge on shipping to Hawaii or Alaska of $50.00 NOTE: I only sell to e-Bay members who have PayPal accounts in good standing and with confirmed addresses, as PayPal is my only accepted method of payment.

Thank you. No e-checks either please!From molten rock to modern metal, the Schecter Damien Elite-6 can handle it. Just plug it into your favorite amp and listen to those EMG pickups roar. Between the neck and humbucker, you've got a bunch of fat tones to choose from. And the Floyd Rose bridge gives you serious sustain flexability. Add in Grover Rotomatic tuners, and you've got an axe that's both shred-ready and dependable. Top it off with the fresh look of the Gothic crosses inlays and the deal is sealed: you've got a stylish, tone-packed guitar in the Schecter Damien Elite-6 FR.
