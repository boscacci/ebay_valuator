{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "For sale is a vintage 1980 Vantage electric guitar, made at the Matsumoku factory. This is the Phantom VA-800 model, which was their top of the line solid body electric that year. Everything is original including the pick-ups (which I believe were made by Di Marzio ?), brass saddles and nut. The truss rod cover is missing unfortunately. The guitar is in very good shape, with only a few minor bumps and dents. Has an ash, maple and walnut body with a maple neck. The electronics, including the split coils switch, all work fine, except the input jack is a bit scratchy when you plug in. Frets are in excellent shape -- virtually no wear. This MIJ guitar was made at the renowned Matsumoku factory which also produced guitars by Epiphone, Washburn, Fender, Ibanez, Electra, etc., as well as many other so-called lawsuit Gibson, Martin, Guild and Fender copy guitars. Comes with the original hardshell Vantage case! Please note: Item is located in Toronto Canada. Shipping will be by Canada Post. Shipping will be around $100 but may be less, depending on distance and actual cost.
