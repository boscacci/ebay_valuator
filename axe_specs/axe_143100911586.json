{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Hello eBay Friends! For sale today we have a used 1995 PRS 2009 Custom 24 10-Top Electric Guitar Blue Flame with FREE SHIPPING! (Serial Number: 5 21553). Guitar is \"10-Top\" (see pictures) and has the prestigious \"PRS\" Signature Club Truss Rod Cover\" dated for (S 08/09) This guitar was personally autographed for me by Paul Reed Smith in 1997 when I worked at Lentine's Music in Cleveland, Ohio (see pictures for this). Guitar is in good condition, plays very smooth and I have been the only owner. Guitar will be shipped WITH insurance and tracking information to insure delivery and value. Please note the following full disclosures on the guitar (see pictures for details): #1: The Bridge will need a super good cleaning, their is serious corrosion in the bridge so cleaning and or replacing the Bridge would be the recommendation. This is a perfect job if you are guitar techie type of person :-) #2: Since this guitar is from 1995 the guitar does have 3 \"Dings\" that I have clearly outlined in the pictures, the most notable one is on the face of the guitar and the other are on the back of the neck. #3: Frets have been worn down a bit and the guitar plays fine but down the road their might be a consideration of getting a fret job done. #4: To my knowledge if I remember correctly the pick ups are the PRS HFS Treble Pickup (Neck Position) and PRS Vintage Bass Pickup (Bridge Position). PRS \"10 Top\" Information For Value Evaluation: A very small percent of the maple trees cut in North America are actually figured. To make \"10-Top\" status, a PRS top must have clearly defined figure across its entire top with no \"dead\" spots. A guitar designated as a 10-Top will usually have a small \"10\" written on the back of the headstock in the upper right corner. (Please see the picture I posted to verify). Buy with confidence, I have a 100% PERFECT eBay selling score! All reasonable bid offers considered and same day or next day 9:00 AM shipping happens with instant verified Pay Pal payment. I sell internationally with the Global Shipping Program. Please note that after it reaches the eBay international shipping location for shipping overseas you will have to pay shipping from that point forward. I pay the free shipping to get it to the eBay international shipping location. Customs regulations vary by country and not all carriers ship to all locations. This is clearly specified in this listing so you are responsible for paying these additional fees into your country if you are not a USA buyer. Cheers!
