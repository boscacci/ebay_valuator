{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "Details: I checked the serial number on the head-stock and dated this guitar back to 2000 using \"The Guitar Dater Project\"https://www.guitardaterproject.org/ibanez.aspx Your guitar was made at the Fuji-gen Plant, Japan in 2000 Production Number: 2977 You can also cross-check this with the Ibanez wiki-page: http://ibanez.wikia.com/wiki/RG7420_(2000-2002) I mainly bought this guitar because I'm obsessed with 7 string guitars and specifically Japanese made 7 string guitars. This was a chance to own a beautiful piece of history and I had to have it. Sadly, I don't play music anymore and I can't afford to have so many instruments so this is the one that has to go. I'm not the first owner of this guitar. It had the Seymour Duncan 7 string pickups when I bought it. It was well set up when I purchased it and immediately playable which is also why I haven't had a chance to remove the pickups and see what model pickups they are. But even the cheapest Seymour Duncan 7 string pickups are around $200. I tune half a step down so the guitar is currently set up for that tuning. But as with all floating tremolo instruments, you'll need to adjust the tremolo when you re-adjust the tuning. I bought 2 new tremolo springs (original parts from Ibanez) but will ship the previous springs too. I prefer the tension on the new springs for my tuning. It ships with the gig-bag seen in the pictures. I also made some D.I.Y tremolo-stoppers using some wood and tape. Happy to ship those out too. They're surprisingly effective and easy to slide in and out of the tremolo cavity if needed. I will also ship the tremolo bar that came with the guitar. I'll also throw in a planet-waves locking strap because I'm nice. Condition:The guitar is 18 years old so I don't recommend purchasing this guitar if you're looking for a brand new instrument. This guitar is in perfect playing condition but cosmetically has a bunch of dings and dents. I tried to capture as many of the significant dings as I could in the last image. I WILL NOT ACCEPT RETURNS on shipped orders so please ask as many questions and request more pictures if you need to before purchasing it. If you're local to Philadelphia I would prefer a local pickup and I'm happy to offer returns. I am skeptical of all shipping agencies but will ship with whatever method you wish at your cost.", "ItemID": "163564627828", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T17:24:48.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-25T05:19:07.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-RG7420-7-String-Guitar-Seymour-Duncan-Pickup-Magenta-Japan-Fuji-gen-2000-/163564627828", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1635646278288080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTI2OVgxNjAw/z/pgkAAOSwniVcGroz/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTE2OFgxNjAw/z/UugAAOSwLSZcGrsO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/vJEAAOSwpLVcGrsZ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mHcAAOSwn01cGruN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjA5/z/mI4AAOSwn01cGrug/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pZsAAOSw0xtcGrur/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/uL0AAOSwEvZcGruy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjQ4WDE2MDA=/z/EZ8AAOSws2RcGrvN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NjkzWDE2MDA=/z/zTQAAOSw1uVcGrvW/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTExOVgxNjAw/z/L4sAAOSw2~NcGrv3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HOsAAOSwwXRcGrwQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAwMFgxMDAw/z/z8QAAOSwEONcGsEx/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "19104", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "the_singularity7", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 13, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 500.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": ".***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ibanez RG7420 7 String Guitar Seymour Duncan Pickup Magenta Japan Fuji-gen 2000 ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Basswood"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Ibanez RG"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2000"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["Yes"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["RG7420"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["7 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["Japan"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Modification Description", "Value": ["The guitar has been upgraded with a set of new Seymour Duncan pickups.
