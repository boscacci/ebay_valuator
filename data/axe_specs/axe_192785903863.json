The SG model was originally intended to replace the Les Paul, which temporarily went out of production from 1961-1968. The G-400 PRO is constructed using the same dimensions and build techniques as vintage SGs and features a mahogany body and neck with a comfortable 1960s SlimTaper \"D\" profile and a 24.75\" scale length. The pau ferro fingerboard has pearloid Trapezoid inlays, 22 medium jumbo frets, a 12\" radius, and an adjustable truss rod with a \"bell\" cover.Alnico Classic PRO Humbuckers with Coil SplittingThe G-400 PRO features Alnico Classic PRO humbuckers made with Alnico-V magnets, which produce a slightly higher output especially in the mids and highs. Each pickup has it own Volume and Tone control with full-size 500K potentiometers matched with Epiphones rugged, all-metal, 3-way toggle pickup selector switch for long-lasting performance. Each pickup also is wired for coil-tapping. By pulling up the pickups volume knob, the humbucker will become a \"single-coil\" pickup, allowing players an infinite variety of tones from single-coil bark to full humbucker bite. When winding humbuckers, Epiphone utilizes a double vacuum waxing process that ensures quiet operation free from microphonic hum. The pickup is first placed in the specialized wax vacuuming system before the cover is placed on the unit to ensure that the wax fully penetrates to the very center of the pickup and solidifies all parts. After the cover is placed on, it is again given a second vacuum wax bath until the unit is completely saturated with wax. Epiphone also uses high quality ABS plastic bobbins, 1010 Cold Rolled Steel pole shoes and pole screws, the finest magnet wire available.Solid Epiphone HardwareThe G-400 PRO features Epiphones legendary LockTone bridge and Stopbar tailpiece for incredible sustain along with Wilkinson Vintage Classic Machine Heads with a 18:1 tuning ratio.Get your Epiphone G-400 PRO Electric Guitar today at the guaranteed lowest price from Sam Ash with our 45-day return and 60-day price protection policy.
