{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "This is a 1997 Fender California Series Fat Telecaster originally purchased in 1999. The California series was manufactured for only 2 years at the Fender USA facility but painted and finishes applied at the Fender Mexican plant in Ensenada, Baja California. The body is alder with a maple neck. This is not your normal Tele. It has a Fender humbucker for the neck pickup and a Tex-Mex strat pickup at the bridge.The bridge is a six-saddle vintage Fender bridge, and the tuners are vintage Kluson style. With both a humbucker and strat pickup this guitar is capable of playing just about any musical style by using the standard Telecaster switch to select the pickup you want to use. The 20+year old guitar has a few minor chips and dings. There is minor buckle rash on the back caused by one of my rhythm players picking up and playing the instrument without my permission. He lived but just barely when I saw the damage. It is hard to see in the photos, but it is noticeable if you see it in person. The scratches don't show up in photos very well. Any bid at or above the opening bid that wins the auction will have the guitar shipped in a hard shell case. If I accept a bid less than that no case will be included in the shipment.", "ItemID": "292929960032", "EndTime": "2019-01-23T12:14:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-22T20:49:12.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-California-Series-Fat-Telecaster-1997-case-/292929960032", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Pearland, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/2929299600328080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ruAAAOSws6dcR3uK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BnAAAOSwIS9cR3u4/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/n~IAAOSwoEFcR3up/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/RR0AAOSw-yJcR3vN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/uGgAAOSwSidcR3vj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTAxNFgxNjAw/z/SJgAAOSwfMlcR3vv/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/WO4AAOSwwOBcR3v-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Oy4AAOSwakxcR3wV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0x4AAOSwXTVcR3wl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/xRIAAOSw6CRcR3w1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IZIAAOSwlZ1cR3xT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "77581", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "cobbo1950", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 17, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 450.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***e", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 880}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender California Series Fat Telecaster 1997 with case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["California series Fat Tele"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Candy Apple Red"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Alder"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["1997"]}, {"Name": "Soundboard Style", "Value": ["Flat Top"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Product Line", "Value": ["Fender Special Run"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["United States"]}]}, "HitCount": 51, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 455.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Good to Very Good", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
