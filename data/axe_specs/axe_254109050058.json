{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Epiphone Les Paul Standard Electric Guitar (Blue) with Case Measures 40.5\" LAO / 13\" Diameter Weight: 14 lbs. 12 oz (Guitar and Case) ============== NOTICE Please note that FEDEX Ground is generally the least expensive method of shipping, especially to the west coast. However, it is the slowest. Currently it is taking about 10 to 14 days for delivery. If time is crucial you may prefer to look at UPS or USPS Priority Mail as an alternative \u2013 these are usually more expensive but much faster. ========================== No International Shipping. However, I can ship this item to a friend or relative of yours in the states who can then send it to you. ======================= Please visit my store at mc_antiques to view nearly 1,000 listings of retro, vintage and antique items of all genre. I sell reasonably priced antiques, art and other artifacts of interest with a few quality sundry industrial items added. My inventory comprises items NOT fresh off the shelf from Walmart. As with most antiques these items are used, a little worn with a few dings, scratches, chipping or bruises - indicative of previous use. Most antique collectors appreciate these little residuals of age. It is considered a part of the \u201cpatina.\u201d I use high-resolution photos, taken from many angles & perspectives. Take a close look at the item you are appraising for purchase. I include any major flaw or damage of the item in the description, but minor flaws must be discerned from the photos. If the item does not meet your standards, or if you prefer new items, by no means purchase it. Some people should never purchase antiques or vintage items. You will not be happy and I only want satisfied customers.", "ItemID": "254109050058", "EndTime": "2019-02-08T02:38:20.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-04T11:38:43.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Standard-Electric-Guitar-Blue-Case-/254109050058", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Plainfield, Massachusetts", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal", "CashOnPickup"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2541090500588080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/NDgAAOSwc9VcTkBN/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/7o8AAOSwu3ZcTkB3/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/-K4AAOSwI-tcTkBk/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Ag0AAOSwzgtcTkBt/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/YigAAOSwjQVcTkC2/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/~M4AAOSw6hNcTkCL/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/BOIAAOSwb15cTkCe/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/pl8AAOSwWWRcTkCp/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/dfUAAOSwn4ZcTkCB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ogEAAOSwmrNcTkCV/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/rAoAAOSwiwZcTkBE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/mj0AAOSwvDpcTkBX/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "01070", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mc_antiques", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1079, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.4, "TopRatedSeller": true}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 290.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 290.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "n***-", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 7}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Les Paul Standard Electric Guitar (Blue) with Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Blue"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Standard"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 122, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1331031186", "StoreName": "mcantiquesandcollectables"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Very Good Condition.
