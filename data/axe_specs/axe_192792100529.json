The 62 has a rosewood fret board and has eleven pick guard screws.The 57 has a maple fretboard with eight pick guard screws Fender Japan began in 1982 and their JV line of guitars was halted at the end of 1983. The story of these guitars is an interesting read, just search \"1983 JV Strat\" This is another guitar sale from my collection. These 82/83's are getting harder to find. I've had the guitar 18+ years and it has been it's soft case ever since (I don't play guitar). The back plate is missing as is the whammy bar. There a small gouge on the top of the left horn (it's hard to see) and the back has the one spot as shown in the picture. Nice, nice condition. The first Strats made in Japan by Fender were vintage reissue \u201957 and \u201962 replicas, launched in Tokyo on Friday 7th May 1982. The new line of instruments, produced by FujiGen Gakki, featured serial numbers beginning with the letters JV, and they\u2019re accordingly known as the JV series. From the start, there were multiple variants of the JV vintage reissues, serving different price points. Among the variables were the type of finish (either polyester or nitro-cellulose), the body woods, and the neck profiles. Initially, all carried the USA-made pickups for which these early JV series guitars have become renowned, but other parts \u2013 scratchplates for instance \u2013 could be American on the most expensive variant, but Japanese on the cheapest. ).
