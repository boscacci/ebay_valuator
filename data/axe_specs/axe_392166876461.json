You are looking at a Vintage 1960's Teisco Teardrop Electric Guitar. Based on the Vox Teardrop guitar that was made in Italy by EKO, the Teisco model is a really good copy that was made in Japan. The Teisco brand name stands for 'Tokyo Electric Instrument and Sound Company'. Teisco was founded in 1946 by renowned Hawaiian and Spanish guitarist Atswo Kaneko, and electrical engineer Doryu Matsuda. Teisco guitars sold in the United States were labeled \"Teisco Del Rey\" beginning in 1964. Teisco guitars were also imported in the U.S. under several other brand names including but not limited to; Rythmcraft Silvertone, Jedson, Kent, Kingston, Kimberly, Tulio, Heit Deluxe and World Teisco, just to name a few. These guitars were an incredible value and very affordable in their time and by today\u2019s standards they are still a value. Teardrop Semi-Hollow Thinline body with an \"F\" hole. 2 Single Coil Pickups. Rosewood Fretboard and open back tuners. Appears to be mostly original. Trem bar is missing. Has that trashy 1960's tone. Think early Rolling Stones, Kinks, etc. Retrolicious! The \"Real Deal!\" Our luthier did a complete setup. Brand new strings were installed. Gig ready on Arrival! Nut Width: 1.64\" Weight: 5.75 lbs. Complete Package with Original Chipboard Case Included! Due to CITES Treaty for Endangered Wood (Mahogany, Rosewood) We no longer ship out of the USA. Cosmetics: Good Condition. Keep in mind that this is a 55+ year old guitar that has been played. There is some lacquer checking in the finish due to age. Some light strumming scratches on the pickguard as well as on the top. The back has some minor buckle rash scratches. The pickguard is just slightly warped. Neck, Fretboard and Headstock in fine shape. Chipboard case has some scuffs and scratches. All latches work. Dripping with \"Mojo\". It is used. Not perfect. Overall, a really nice guitar. Look at the pictures closely. They will tell the story.
