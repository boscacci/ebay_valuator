It has been used for 60 - 80 hours. It has never been dropped, banged, or hit. From what I can see there are small, faint scratches on the body from being cleaned. These scratches are not easy to see, and I cannot get the camera to pick them up. There is some dust on the guitar than can easily be wiped off. There are no dents at all. Everything on the guitar works beautifully, and it plays very well. Knobs and coils function like new. It has a low action, and that works well for this guitar. The guitar weighs a little over 8lbs, and it was made in 2017. The \"Gator TSA ATA Molded Gibson Les Paul Guitar Case Black\u201d is like new and has only been used around 4 times. As far as I can tell, it may as well be new except for some dust on the outside.", "ItemID": "153373595277", "EndTime": "2019-02-20T03:09:44.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-11T00:26:11.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Epiphone-Limited-Edition-Les-Paul-Plus-PRO-E-Guitar-Desert-Burst-Stain-Case-/153373595277", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Albuquerque, New Mexico", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/1533735952778080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/ODU2WDE1ODc=/z/xp0AAOSwylBcKy3k/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nyYAAOSwOcpcKy2H/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/CJkAAOSwWUBcKy2F/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/opMAAOSwgbdcKy8-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/3xAAAOSwmFxcKy85/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/FbcAAOSwy2pcKy80/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/Nzk5WDE1Nzk=/z/hxUAAOSwm-FcKy4m/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MjQ5WDE1ODc=/z/w-4AAOSwXGRcKy4~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/sQgAAOSwOShcKy2M/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qfQAAOSwEuNcKy2A/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTU3MVg0Nzg=/z/9fQAAOSwg5FcKy8n/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/fygAAOSw9xJcKy10/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "87108", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "fractaltcg", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 247, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 480.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 480.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "_***c", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "None", "FeedbackScore": 1}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Epiphone Limited Edition Les Paul Plus PRO E.Guitar Desert Burst Stain + Case", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Les Paul Traditional"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Les Paul Traditional"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Sunburst"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Maple"]}, {"Name": "Country/Region of Manufacture", "Value": ["China"]}]}, "HitCount": 193, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=1499171547", "StoreName": "Yitura&#39;s Magic Market"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 1, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
