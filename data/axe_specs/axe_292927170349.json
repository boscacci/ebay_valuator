Items must be returned with all original packaging as well as all included items. Items that are not returned in original, resalable condition are subject to a 15% restocking fee. We charge a 15% restocking fee on returned items only if the item is clearly used and or the packaging is tarnished. A 10% re-stock is more likely if the unit comes back in mint condition. The ship cost we paid to ship your item will be deducted as well. In some cases restock fees and ship costs can be applied as a store credit. We will exchange a defective unit for the same unit within the 30-day period. After that period, you will have to work directly with the manufacturer for warranty service. Items that can not be returned include: software, units with contents or packaging that is damaged/missing, and items that are considered for personal use (such as earphones, headphones, microphones, instrument mouthpieces, harmonicas or other items that you wouldn't want to purchase if someone else had previously used them). Also, Items which we do not normally stock (i.e. \"Special Orders\", discontinued products, close-outs, used products, etc.) are non-returnable. We strongly suggest that you check your order after receiving it to be sure that it is in proper working order.
