Item Description The MH-17 includes both an excellent starter guitar with seven strings, and a gig bag so you&rsquo;ll be able to take your instrument to lessons, or out to your friends&rsquo; homes for fun jams. Seven-string guitars are great for modern music styles like metal and progressive rock, where you may want to go lower than the standard range of pitches offered by six-string guitars. The MH-17 has a smooth, comfortable, thin U-shaped maple neck that will make it easier to get around to chords and scales all over the fingerboard with 24 extra-jumbo frets. It has a well-balanced and contoured basswood body that's good for playing while seated or standing. When you're ready to rock, the MH-17's ESP Designed pickups are great for any genre of music you like to play.
