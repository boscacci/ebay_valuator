These H-202's have been one of my favorite players ever since they came out. Right out of the box with Duncan Designed humbuckers and the neck-frets, a metal monster. Have owned several and all were great. Now I need to thin the heard and free up some space.From ESP-LTD,LTD`s H series of solid-bodied electric guitars is made primarily for the younger players who seek a classic metal guitar with a modern edge. H models provide the classic double-cut bodies and classic construction, along with the modern tone and supreme comfort and playability.
