Terms of Sale Tax applies in: NV About Us Family owned and operated since 1958, our company is not just bricks and mortar, computers and signs. It\u2019s people working together to serve the customers and each other. That is our philosophy. While our company today hardly resembles our first small store on Commercial Row, our early values remain.In March of 1958, Dennis and Joan Mack started on the road to business success by purchasing a tiny gift shop with a pawn license, on East Commercial Row in Reno, Nevada, by the name of Palace Jewelry & Loan company.Soon thereafter, a merger with Royal and Madeline Goodsell, Joan\u2019s parents, took place, forming a most compatible and enduring partnership.After over 50 years, two moves and three expansions, \u201cThe Palace\u201d stands apart and above in individuality and vision. The location may have changed, but the philosophy remains the same. \u201cEven with a store full of treasures, none are so valued as our customers and employees.\u201d Things I Buy: Jewelry, Firearms, Diamonds, AUDIO EQUIPMENT, GAMES AND CONSOLES Bravo Store Systems Point-of-Sale Operating System Bravo Omni-Commerce solutions offers Brick & Mortar stores the only fully integrated eBay API that seamlessly & effortlessly combines the in-store Point-of-Sale to all eBay commerce selling activities.
