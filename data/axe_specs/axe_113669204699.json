{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "1976 GRECO SUPER SOUNDS STRATOCASTER, MIJ, Matsumoku, Japan Vintage large headstock, whammy bar, 3 Tone Sunburst, maple neck, Matsumoku DETAILS: Pickups: The pickups sound great. Nice, vintage strat tones. Electronics: Original 3-W switch, works in all positions. The input jack hums if you bump it, but otherwise all electronics work fine. Check out the tank-like switch in the pics. They don't make them like that anymore. Neck: is flat, with the perfect amount (a tiny bit) of relief. If you capo the first fret and put your finger on the last fret of the low E string, there is just a little bit of space between the 8th fret wire and the low E string. Truss Rod: fine. The hex nut on the heel is in great shape. I turned it 1/4 turn to the left, nice and smooth, then gently went back to the right into the original position. Tuners: they all work fine. They are not loose where they connect to the headstock. When you turn them they feel smooth, but if there are no strings attached, the posts where the string wraps around has a little play. Neck: Maple. Flat. Really feels good. No rough spots anywhere along the edges. Frets: Vintage style. There is enough frets left to play, but there are wear spots. Slides are nice and easy. Action/playability: This guitar plays pretty well right now, but it needs fresh strings and a set up. The low and high e strings are right around 2.75mm at the 12th fret. Setup: I don't do setups, especially prior to shipping internationally. But this guitar would play even better after a pro setup. Want to see more of this guitar? CLICK HERE FOR A TON OF PICS Comments and Observations: In my totally biased opinon, it's beautiful. Yes, she has some nicks, dents and scratches from years of use, but the nice three-tone sunburst and the maple neck are gorgeous. She exudes MIJ Strat mojo! Original whammy / tremolo bar included. It's a solid, heavy instrument, and plays well. The 3-way switch is original. Everything appears to be original except for the pickup covers. It's missing one pick guard screw.
