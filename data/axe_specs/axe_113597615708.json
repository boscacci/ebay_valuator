APPROXIMATE MEASUREMENTS: 40 INCHES LONG X 12.5 INCHES WIDE.TUNERS ARE ALSO MARKED \"MARTIN.\" Solid maple body with mahogany center strips in natural finish. HERE'S WHAT ANOTHER EBAYER TOLD ME ABOUT THIS GUITAR: This is actually NOT a Martin EM-18 guitar made in the USA. It was made in Japan and imported by Martin as a \"kit\" guitar for buyers to complete with hardware and electronics of their own choice. Approximately 300 of these guitars were made. Some of them were actually completed by the Martin factory though. The wood on the body of this guitar is ash, not maple. Only the usa made em-18 guitars have maple bodies. The neck is maple while the usa made ones have mahogany necks. These were well made and nice playing guitars and even more rare than a usa made em-18....but were of Japanese manufacture.
