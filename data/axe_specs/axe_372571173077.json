{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "1999 G&L Legacy USA Left Handed 6-String Black Body Electric Guitar CLF SN Item Description:You are bidding on a previously owned and in good playing condition G&L Legacy 6-string left handed electric guitar. This auction is for the guitar and hard case with keys you see pictured. Nothing else is included. It comes as pictured. Please take a moment to look at the pictures and get a better idea of what you are bidding on. The case is a G&L case, but it is not a very good fit for the guitar, so you might want to swap it out. It looks like it may have been made for a different guitar. The case is also missing the handle. This guitar has scratches on the body from play wear that are on and around the front and pickguard. There is a deeper scrape on the back that goes through the black lacquer and finish, down to the wood (see picture 9 for a better look). It looks like it is from buckle rash. There is a nick along the side of the front as you can see in the third picture. The sides of the neck have play wear where the clear coat has rubbed away. The headstock has a few scuffs along the sides. The electronics have been tested and work. The volume pot and switch are both a bit scratchy when adjusted. The neck is straight and the frets have plenty of life in them. The guitar is in good playing condition. The nut is 1-5/8\". Please take a moment to check out my other great items!
