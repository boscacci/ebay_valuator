{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Rare ORIGINAL HAGSTROM lll (not Chinese retrospect) Guitar, Made in Sweden in 1964It is in very good overall condition considering the age, it has only a few blemishes like shown in picture 12.(please scrutinize the pictures and again ask questions when in doubt)Almost original, but whammy bar with screw is missing. Even the original strap buttons and router cavity button are there.
