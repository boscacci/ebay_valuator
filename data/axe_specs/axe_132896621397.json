{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I am thinning out my very large collection of stringed instruments (numbering nearly 200), which I began in the 1970's. This listing is for a vintage Ibanez Artist AR-300 solidbody guitar. This beauty is in great condition (made in Japan, serial K814112). Sounds amazing and is comparable to any Gibson Les Paul at a fraction of the price. A very versatile instrument which holds its own ibn any style. This guitar was endorsed and played by George Benson, Steve Miller, Steve Lukather, Mike Rutherford (Genesis) and Robben Ford back in the day when it was in production. Features of this Ibanez Artist AR-300 include: Double cut mahogany solid body shape with carved maple top finished in a stunning vintage violinburst (a clean guitar with only slight buckle rash on back)Cream binding along front of body and both sides of the neck (aged to a nice yellowish color)3 Piece maple neck with a medium thin C profileBound ebony fretboard with medium size frets (very little fret wear)Two Ibanez original Super 58 humbuckers3 Way selector, phase shift and coil-cut switches, 2 volume/2 tone amber knobs (knobs are upgrade replacements)Gold Ibanez tuning keys (1 tuner--G string--replaced)Mother of pearl & abalone block inlaysIbanez stop tail piece (one nut missing on top of bridge--doesn't affect playability)Gold hardware (some pitting as expected on a 37 year old instrument)Original Ibanez hardshell case Overall condition is a very clean 8.5/10--unbelievable for a guitar of this vintage and it weighs 9.5 lbs.
