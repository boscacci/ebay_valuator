{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "No there is no reserve, but that\u2019s as low as I\u2019m willing to start the bidding because I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to begin AND end there. There are so many special things about this guitar I hope I can remember them all. Here goes. First it\u2019s from the PRS WOOD LIBRARY. These are not Private Stock but it provided a few of the Private Stock options to dealers only. You can Goggle that phrase to find out more. Color: Faded Whale Blue Top Wood: Quilt 10 Top Back Wood: Mahogany Neck Wood: Mahogany Fretboard Wood: African Blackwood Neck Shape: Pattern Thin Fretboard Inlay: Gold Mother of Pearl Outlines and Abalone Center Bird \u2028 Bridge: PRS Patented Tremolo, Gen III Tuners: PRS Phase III Locking Hardware Type: Hybrid \u2028 Treble Pickup: 57/08 Treble Bass Pickup: 57/08 Bass (Vintage alnico magnets and wire from the original machine that made the 1957 pickup wire) Controls: McCarty Switching (3-way toggle, push pull, coil tap, tone knob) \u2028 It has a custom truss rod cover but I will also send the original with it. Very nice case that has never been used. (with case candy, and factory certificate from PRS) \u2028 \u2028 It's been set up professionally and of course plays great. These pickups have a great clarity, and you can coax quite a variety of tones from them (especially using the tone control, never heard a guitar that has such an efficient tone knob). \u2028 The pictures I took actually capture the guitar pretty well. But it does tend to change some depending on the light. I know that's kind of an obvious thing to say but this thing changes like the seasons. As far as aesthetics go I guess I've seen a few guitars as beautiful but none more. \u2028 The condition I'm gonna have to say is mint, not exactly like new because if you scrutinize it very closely you can see faint signs of use. But I bought it new and it has never left my house and has been well taken care of and there are certainly not any dings of any kind, anywhere at all. It could use some new strings and of course the fretboard and pickups polished with the strings off, and in fact if you did that the guitar would look like new. So thats about as good as I can do. If you have specific questions please ask. But I can honestly say that you are going to pretty much feel like you're getting a new guitar here. It really has not been played that much. (I have a lot! of guitars I can choose from to play). It cost 4200.00. You'd have to try really hard not to love this guitar. I'm not selling it with enthusiasm.", "ItemID": "273727460827", "EndTime": "2019-03-01T17:39:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-02-24T17:39:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/PRS-Custom-24-10-Top-Wood-Library-57-08-Pickups-Mint-/273727460827", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Mount Juliet, Tennessee", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2737274608278080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LqwAAOSwqIhb8GJM/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/TG0AAOSwYUZb8GJO/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/jmsAAOSwbbJb8GJQ/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/r6MAAOSwU1Nb8GJR/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/hxYAAOSwmfhb8GJT/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/sDcAAOSwJ6Vb8GJV/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/7qAAAOSwzhZb8GJX/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/c8wAAOSw~rhb8GJY/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/ym8AAOSwySZb8GJa/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0RoAAOSwXItb8GJc/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/Q4cAAOSw5-hb8GJe/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/0ksAAOSw-4Jb8GJf/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "37122", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "mr.babylonblue", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 514, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 2800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 2800.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "e***1", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1517}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "PRS Custom 24, 10 Top, Wood Library, 57/08 Pickups.
