The cost of the chosen shipping service estimated by the weight, size, and destination of the package. (Not Present on the printed package label.) The cost of Stamps.com shipping insurance which averages from $1.29 to $5.06 depending on the item value. (Not Present on the printed package label.) The cost of packaging which varies from $.26 to $7.80 depending on the size and type of package.(Not Present on the printed package label.) The cost of bubble wrap and tape if it is necessary for the package. This can be $.00 to $1.05 depending on the size and type of package.(Not Present on the printed package label.) The cost of the label and printer ink. This cost is $.17.(Not Present on the printed package label.) Ebay's 9% final shipping value fee they now charge sellers on shipping costs. This can range from $.29 to $8.32. Ebay charges this fee because to many buyers have complained about high shipping fees. Ebay feels this fee will help curve the issue. Coincidentally Ebay does not return this fee to the buyer, but keeps it for themselves. We feel that if the average buyer was made aware of the real total shipping costs, then maybe they would be less likely to assuming the cost of shipping on the package label is the total cost of shipping. For Example, when you pay $35 for shipping on a guitar body from us and then read only $25 on the package label, keep in mind that there are other unseen costs that go into the total shipping cost. We charge only the bare minimum for shipping. We want to remove this final shipping value fee from our total shipping fees in order to bring them down again. So buyers, please contact Ebay and push them to remove this seller fee from their system. Ebay must learn to stop punishing all sellers for the faults of only a few. Also, we have some of the best experience with shipping these products around the country and world. Whenever we search through listings we rarely see shipping charges that are much more than the total cost of shipping from other sellers. Much of the time we see charges where the seller is likely losing money on the final value because of their low shipping charges. USA Shipping Winner pays for all shipping and packaging costs.
