{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "for your consideration is a nice ebony Epiphone SG - 400 plays great everything works as it should ..no fret wear .. there are no major chips or scratches on the body .just normal signs of use .. the only modification I made was to the strap button ..it was moved to the top of the horn Tony Iommi style . I do it to all my SG guitars I just find it more balanced .. also the back of the neck was painted when I got the guitar the previous owner decided to sand it ! some people don't like the gloss finish because when your hand gets clammy from playing the gloss tends to make your hand stick and makes it hard to play we all experienced that .. and I did not mind that it was sanded but he took off a little to much paint and I was able to see the scarf joint ! I don't like seeing the scarf joint so I painted it a flat black which takes care of the gloss problem and your hand does not stick !! at the top of the neck I did not want a straight line from gloss to flat so I buffed it to look uneven \u2026 and before you think it was painted to hide a repair ? NO the neck was never broken or repaired ! check my feedback I have sold many guitars in the past and I would never sell one that had a problem without disclosing it to the buyer ..so I can assure you this guitar is solid and will play great .. when I sell a guitar its because I have one to many or I do a custom ! this is a good player it looks great and comes with a nice hard case .. you will not be disappointed ! the pickups are CH HOT bridge and CH 57 neck", "ItemID": "292855195798", "EndTime": "2018-12-12T11:52:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-08T02:41:29.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ebony-Epiphone-SG-G-400-Electric-Guitar-nice-TKL-hard-case-/292855195798", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Ormond Beach, Florida", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2928551957988080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/nQQAAOSwAQVcACc6/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/f~MAAOSwJtJcACdc/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/Cw0AAOSw8DpcACdx/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/HvsAAOSwlAFcACeN/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/2LUAAOSwV0VcACeo/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/s9gAAOSwkelcACe9/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/FIUAAOSwkvtcACfY/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/C64AAOSw8DpcACfw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/H~MAAOSwlAFcACgW/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/oLYAAOSw~T9cACgw/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/PgAAAOSwztVcAChM/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/qL4AAOSwEONcAChz/$_32.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "32174", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "titan985", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1289, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 99.1}, "BidCount": 1, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 225.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "a***a", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 11}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Ebony Epiphone SG G-400 Electric Guitar with nice\u00a0 TKL hard case ", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2013"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Epiphone"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Mahogany"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}]}, "HitCount": 187, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 227.5, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ProductID": {"Value": "78587404", "Type": "Reference"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America"], "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
