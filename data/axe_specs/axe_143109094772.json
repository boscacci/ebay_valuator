The guitar is in great shape and I will include a Gig Bag from the world famous House of Guitars in Rochester NY. I will pay for shipping in the lower 48 states. Read my feedback and buy with confidence. Get John 5's Blistering Tone at a Very Friendly Price The Squier John 5 Signature Telecaster solidbody electric guitar puts a modern guitar icon's axe in your hands for an unbeatable price. Using a custom humbucker with a ceramic magnet in the bridge position and an Alnico 5\u2013based humbucker in the neck, the J5 Telecaster can go from clean to scream with no problem. The controls are also specially configured for John 5's style of play. Though it's perfectly capable of clean snap, this Telecaster definitely shines when it's time to crank up and cut loose. Carve your own sonic signature with the J5 Telecaster.Hot pickups, custom controls Installed Dimarzio Dactivator pickups use a special dual-volume setup with the bridge pickup control in the front position and the neck pickup control in the back position (John 5 prefers this setup because he spends a lot of time giving the bridge pickup a workout). Rapidly toggling the upper-bout 3-way pickup switch gives you 5's signature kill effect by turning off the neck pickup volume and leaving the bridge control all the way up.Built for power This unusual Telecaster produces high-octane tone and output for great modern sounds. You also get a 3-way pickup selector switch and distinctive gold hardware. And even with all this power under the hood, the pickups sound fantastic for cleaner styles like classic country and jazz. With such a bold personality, you may be surprised at how much flexibility the Squier John 5 Telecaster has to offer.It's a Tele and then some Based on a classic Tele design, the heart of the J5 Telecaster is an instantly recognizable alder body, a maple neck with a very comfortable modern C-shape, dual volume controls, and an Indian laurel fingerboard. This axe also features die-cast tuning machines, a 6-saddle Tele humbucker bridge, and a bound top and back. Fender got the look and feel of the Telecaster right back in the 1950s. John 5 saw no reason to change it up.Squier John 5 Signature Telecaster Solidbody Electric Guitar Features: Humbucker-loaded Telecaster with wide sonic possibilities Balanced-sounding alder body2 powerful humbucking pickups that clean up beautifullyComfortable maple C-shaped neck with Indian laurel fingerboardUnique dual master volume controlsBold gold finish with matching gold-painted headstockBound top and backToggle switch mounted on upper bout", "ItemID": "143109094772", "EndTime": "2019-02-04T00:32:46.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-30T00:32:46.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Fender-John-5-Gold-Telecaster-signed-/143109094772", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "North Tonawanda, New York", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/pict/1431090947728080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/m8sAAOSw7F9cOl0h/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wkQAAOSwkv5cOl0q/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ScYAAOSwqRlcOl0w/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/L9QAAOSwv0dcOl0P/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/IdkAAOSwI01cOl0I/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/8lUAAOSw76JcOl0N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "14120", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "shanty1962", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 891, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 8, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 555.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 555.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "l***s", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Purple", "FeedbackScore": 814}, "ListingStatus": "Completed", "QuantitySold": 1, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT0S", "Title": "Fender John 5 Gold Telecaster signed", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fender"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Telecaster"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold"]}]}, "HitCount": 178, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 565.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "ExcludeShipToLocation": ["Alaska/Hawaii", "US Protectorates", "APO/FPO", "Africa", "Asia", "Central America and Caribbean", "Europe", "Middle East", "North America", "Oceania", "Southeast Asia", "South America", "PO Box"], "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Excellent.", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
