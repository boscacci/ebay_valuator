{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "In order to save time on listings so I can provide a wider selection for you, I have made up my own grading scale (below) for the condition of this item. I will do my best to rely more on my pictures to really tell you the true condition of my items. Remember these are pre-owned, none of my sunglasses / frames will be 100%, though some maybe really close to brand new condition. FRAME GRADE FOR THIS ITEM: A- GRADE FRAME SCALE: (A): Like new, maybe a couple scratches you can only really tell with a magnify glass. (B): A few very light scratches/scuffs that aren't oh my gosh noticeable but are there. (C): Decent amount of scratches / scuffs that are pretty noticeable without being up close to a light. (D): Very noticeable scratches / scuffs with possibility of frame being bent. (F): Parts only pretty much. LENS GRADE FOR THIS ITEM: A- (cracks around where frame connects to lens) not in line of vision and small to notice. GRADE SCALE FOR LENS: (A) -A few tiny light scratches that don't obstruct vision at all! (B) -Tad more light/moderate scratches that really barely obstruct vision. (C) -A small chip(s) in the lens on the corner(s) of lens. (Not in line of vision) -The tint on the lens is flaking off in corners of lens. (Not in line of vision) -Though chip/flake damage isn't in line of vision, there are still light scratches but they do not obstruct vision. (D) 60/40 in favor of replacing lens. Pretty scratched up but doable for some. Please purchase assuming they will need replaced though. (F) Lens will need replaced. ALL MY SUNGLASSES / FRAMES ARE 100% AUTHENTIC. CHECK MY FEEDBACK!
