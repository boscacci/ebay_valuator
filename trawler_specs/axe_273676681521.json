{"BestOfferEnabled": true, "Description": "I might have gone a little overboard with the mandocello craze. This thing isn't getting much play time, so I figured I'd see what I could get for it! There's a guy named MORTone (the guy who did this conversion) who lists quite a few of these conversions for those wanting to try mandocellos out. I don't intend to resell this for much at all, so this could be a good chance to try out a cool electric mandocello. Basically, this is a 10 string guitar tuned in pairs. The strings are Cc, Gg, Dd, aa, ee...like a cello, but with a high e string added. It's REALLY cool for post rock, shoe gaze, etc., and it's a lot of fun for experimenting. The conversion came out awesome. As far as the finish, you'll see in the photo there are a few cracks in the finish....I can't remember if I bought this \"new\" or \"used\", so they might've happened during shipping. I'm not too sure. However, they are only cosmetic, and the neck and bridge of the guitar are set pretty well. If I were buying this, the first things I'd change are the pickups and the nut. The pickups aren't bad, but they aren't amazing either. They sound good pushed a little bit through a tube amp and/or some pedals. The nut is cut for unison tuning (and even then it's still the old guitar nut). So if you want to keep it in octave tuning, I'd get a new nut cut. The bridge works out surprisingly well....not sure where he got it from!", "ItemID": "273676681521", "EndTime": "2019-02-05T00:21:56.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-29T00:21:56.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Cozart-10-String-Mandocello-Conversion-Strat-Guitar-/273676681521", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Houston, Texas", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs2.ebaystatic.com/pict/2736766815218080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/pjoAAOSwRGhcT5n~/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/D-IAAOSw7OdcT5oB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/UNkAAOSwK9ZcT5oE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/wzcAAOSwvytcT5oG/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/wMwAAOSwvNVcT5oJ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/sWAAAOSwl1RcT5oM/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTA2NlgxNjAw/z/6fsAAOSwqrZcT5oO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/P3sAAOSw-iZcT5oQ/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/zpQAAOSwLnRcT5oS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/qu0AAOSwvwRcT5oU/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMDY2/z/U6QAAOSwGVRcT5oh/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "77023", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "checkoutmygarage", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Yellow", "FeedbackScore": 49, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 2, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 81.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 81.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "HighBidder": {"UserID": "h***o", "FeedbackPrivate": false, "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 121}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "PT5H40M17S", "Title": "Cozart 10 String Mandocello Conversion Strat Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["10 String"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Cozart"]}]}, "HitCount": 201, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "MinimumToBid": {"Value": 82.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "barely played, some finish cracks", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
