{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for auction is a cozart 57' style LP guitar. This guitar has a 2 piece body of some really nice looking mahogany. I can't remember if it has a maple top or not. Guitar has been upgraded extensively. It has a guitar madness P90 pickup, a Wilkinson bridge that's adjustable for intonation. the original bridge wasn't even close to intonating. Grover tuners and a fret level, dress and polish. the fret board was polished very well too. the fret board is made of wenge which is kind of unique I thought. I didn't upgrade the volume and tone pots because they actually have a very nice sweep to them so I left them in. I also scraped the binding on the front of the guitar...the binding was completely painted over, now it looks much nicer. I make acoustic guitars so used the appropriate razor holder scraper. I was going to go back and block sand it but it looks fine as is. Guitar comes with a lightweight gigbag and is already boxed up in a heavy epiphone brand box. Guitar is used so has some scratches here and there and a paint chip missing where the new bridge was installed/3rd pic.", "ItemID": "283349206051", "EndTime": "2019-02-21T19:57:41.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-22T19:57:41.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/57-STYLE-LP-GOLD-TOP-6-STRING-ELECTRIC-GUITAR-Tons-upgrades-P90-junior-/283349206051", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Opelika, Alabama", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833492060518080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/NvUAAOSwwgBcR3PK/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/kxkAAOSwr~9cR3PO/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAxWDE2MDA=/z/GhEAAOSw2qpcR3PS/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/LBQAAOSwTNhcR3Pd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/eusAAOSwGPNcR3Pd/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/aYkAAOSwbKVcR3Ph/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/pwQAAOSwa3FcR3Pj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/3D4AAOSw1rpcR3Pn/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDE=/z/KykAAOSwws5cR3Pq/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAxWDE2MDA=/z/UwAAAOSwC~9cR3k1/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "36801", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "staticrecurve", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1992, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 199.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P17DT1H15M50S", "Title": "'57 STYLE LP  GOLD TOP 6 STRING ELECTRIC GUITAR Tons of upgrades P90 junior", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Size", "Value": ["Full Size"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Gold"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["2019"]}, {"Name": "Modified Item", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Custom Bundle", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Model Year", "Value": ["2019"]}, {"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Type", "Value": ["Electric Guitar"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Cozart"]}, {"Name": "Non-Domestic Product", "Value": ["No"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 415, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Storefront": {"StoreURL": "https://stores.ebay.com/id=31818528", "StoreName": "WM gun grips and archery"}, "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "30 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
