{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "BuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 140.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "Description": "This is my vintage Lotus Strat style guitar.I have owned this guitar for over 25 years.About 20 years ago a friend and studio guitarist took this guitar home and switched out the pickups and it has sounded great ever since.Unfortunately, he passed away a few years ago, and I never asked him about the pickups because they sounded so good I did not care what they were. This guitar has spent a lot of time on the road and in the studio, and it is a joy to play.Great neck and very good frets. Intonation is good and harmonics are nice.All I can say is that this is not your average Lotus guitar.If you want great sound and a fun guitar to play for a reasonable price, this is it.Sold as is, so please look at the pictures and ask questions.", "ItemID": "254104394879", "BuyItNowAvailable": true, "ConvertedBuyItNowPrice": {"Value": 140.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "EndTime": "2019-02-05T23:28:59.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-31T23:28:59.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Used-Lotus-electric-guitar-/254104394879", "ListingType": "Chinese", "Location": "Freeport, Illinois", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/2541043948798080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/3Y4AAOSwIS9cU4Fl/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/QkUAAOSw~llcU4HB/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/e8QAAOSwRbpcU4GE/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/X8UAAOSw6X1cU4F7/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/9k4AAOSw6eRcU4GT/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/AFEAAOSw7bxcU4Gj/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/ByEAAOSweI1cU4Gy/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "61032", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "ranger69black", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Red", "FeedbackScore": 1051, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 100.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P1DT2H57M34S", "Title": "Used Lotus electric guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Lotus"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Right-/ Left-Handed", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}]}, "HitCount": 64, "Subtitle": "Vintage guitar with a great sound!!!!!
