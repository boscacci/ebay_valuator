The Epiphone Dot Studio, A New Twist on the Rock and Roll Machine The Epiphone Dot, Epiphone's version of the venerable ES-335 \u201cDot\u201d, has been wowing guitar players all over the world for a decade. Vintage models (with vintage problems) can\u2019t complete with our Epiphone Dot, which is simply one of the best deals today for guitar players who want the classic sound of an ES-335 at an affordable price. Now the Dot Studio gives players the exact same sound and quality in a stripped down studio model made of mahogany. Similar to our Les Paul Studio, the Dot Studio has all the tone and functionality of our \u201cDot\u201d but with a fabulous Vintage Sunburst or Cherry finish. Epiphone is long famous for its own original semi-hollowbody models from the 1950s Kalamazoo, Michigan era, including the Riviera and the Sheraton. During the same time those guitars were being designed and constructed in Kalamazoo, the ES 335, first introduced in 1958, became a favorite of blues, rock, country, and pop acts for its elegant design and wide array of colorful tone combinations. Now, the Epiphone Dot Studio, named in reference to its mahogany body and plain fingerboard, opens up the availability of the sustain and resonance of the semi-hollow design for a bounty less than most solid body guitars. The \u201cDot\u201d is the same axe that has been the bell weather of every rock and roll breakthrough. And now for the first time, the \u201cDot\u201d puts that classic sound and over 40 years of refinements in your hands, the Epiphone way.

Cash Indiana Pawn Shop is a chain of family owned Pawnshops in NW Indiana. In 1963, Jack converted the Diner Bell restaurant into Jack's Gun Shop at the current Burns Harbor location. For the next two decades Jack\u2019s Gun Shop operated as the one stop shop for hunters, fisherman, trap shooters, and other outdoor enthusiasts. During the early 1980\u2019s economic depression Jack realized the need and opportunity to diversify and expand his business. Thus Jacks Gun Shop was converted into Jack\u2019s Gun & Pawn shop. In 1992, Jack and Cathy opened their second store at the current Lake Station location and then in 1994 they opened their Michigan City store creating today\u2019s Cash Indiana Corporation. From day one Jack and Cathy\u2019s motto has been to treat every customer, as they would want to be treated with respect and fairness. This motto has bought them great success and satisfaction in helping NW Indiana with their financial troubles. \u200bOur goal is a happy customer. We strive for excellence.
