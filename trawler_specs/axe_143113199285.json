This is a Offset Short-Scale Electric Guitar, based on the original models from the 1956. 24\" Scale with Single Coil Pickups. Popular with Alternative and Indie Players. Awesome Playing and Sounding Guitar in MINT CONDITION! From The Web: Beginning in 1956, the Fender Duo-Sonic solidbody electric guitar has been the choice of adventurous musicians that dig Fender style but want something a little different than a Tele or a Strat. The Duo-Sonic's unique voice is due to its 24\" scale length, which makes it playable and unique in tone. The Duo-Sonic also has that slinky feel \u2014 extended chords are easier to finger, and you can pull off multistep bends easily. A pair of single-coil pickups delivers sweet, glassy Fender tone, with sound shaping provided by a 3-way pickup selector and master volume and tone controls. And with the new pau ferro fingerboard used by Stevie Ray Vaughan during his career, you can experience that beautifully rich, thick tone and playability that this unique wood offers.Shorter scale good for new players and seasoned alike The Duo-Sonic has long been a favorite among beginners and players with smaller hands, thanks to its shorter 24\" scale length. Easier chording isn't all that the shorter scale has to offer \u2014 it lends a slinky feel to this guitar and makes it easier to pull off big string bends.This neck feels like home With a \"C\" profile and 9.5\" fretboard radius, the Fender Duo-Sonic will feel familiar to any Fender fan. One thing we really dig at Sweetwater is that the neck is finished in satin polyurethane, as opposed to the glossy polyurethane on the body. The satin finish feels fast and smooth in your hand, delivering a broken-in feel from day one.Tech Specs Body Type: Solidbody Body Shape: Duo-Sonic Left-/Right-handed: Right-handed Number of Strings: 6 Body Material: Alder Body Finish: Gloss Polyester Color: Surf Green Neck Material: Maple Neck Shape: C profile Radius: 9.5\" Fingerboard Material: Pau Ferro Fingerboard Inlay: White dots Number of Frets: 22, Medium Jumbo Scale Length: 24\" Nut Width: 1.650\" Nut Material: Synthetic Bone Bridge/Tailpiece: 6-Saddle string thru strat hardtail with bent steel saddles Tuners: Standard cast/sealed Neck Pickup: Duo-Sonic Single-coil Bridge Pickup: Duo-Sonic Single-coil Controls: 1 x master volume, 1 x master tone, 3-way toggle pickup switch Our luthier did a complete setup.
