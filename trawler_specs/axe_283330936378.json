{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "Up for grabs is a not very common Ibanez Flying V, the RVX 220. It has an offset basswood body and a super fast Wizard neck. Bought and assembled this one piece by piece, but the body and neck are both RVX, not from different models. The bridge is an Ibanez Gibraltar that I bought separately. The bridge pickup is a CALIGuitars Terra humbucker. It's a high output ceramic magnet humbucker, inexpensive but quite good sounding. Almost took it out before listing the guitar, but since they're so affordable I decided to leave it in. The neck pickup is from an old LTD I had parted out a while ago. This guitar is in fine working condition and with the Terra bridge pickup it sounds pretty good too. Could use some minor set up, I haven't touched the action or intonation in a long time, but it is otherwise plug and play ready. The Wizard neck is perfect, straight and the frets have nearly zero wear. The neck alone would probably sell for $120, it's in almost new condition. This guitar has various surface scratches, nothing that I could really capture in the pics. The standard pick swirl, plus some minor surface stuff from installing pickups and parts. Nothing major, nothing noticeable unless you're inches away from it. The offset body points are in good shape, not chipped. There is a finish crack in the neck pocket - see last pic. It is only in the finish and does not go through to the wood - standard occurrence on most bolt on neck guitars. Here's the caveat - I've sold and shipped a couple guitars in the past and it's a severe pain, plus it costs too much. If you buy this guitar from me, know that I will take the neck off for shipping. It will cost a whole lot less to ship, and all you need to start playing it will be a screwdriver and strings.", "ItemID": "283330936378", "EndTime": "2019-02-06T15:49:03.000Z", "StartTime": "2019-01-07T15:49:03.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/Ibanez-RVX-220-Flying-V-/283330936378", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "San Pedro, California", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/pict/2833309363788080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/NTwAAOSwjQ9bU93r/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/nHcAAOSwymJbU93w/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/DIAAAOSw77pbU930/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/3QYAAOSw70BbU933/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/onIAAOSwwhxbU936/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/w28AAOSwM1hbU93-/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/NzUAAOSwlulbU94B/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/muAAAOSwejdbU94E/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/yZIAAOSwMSZbU94I/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/OTAwWDE2MDA=/z/BBIAAOSwqz9bU94N/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFg5MDA=/z/3qgAAOSwOvRbU94Y/$_57.JPG?set_id=8800005007"], "PostalCode": "90732", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "zart4741", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 407, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 195.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 195.0, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P1DT20H39M53S", "Title": "Ibanez RVX 220 Flying V", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Dexterity", "Value": ["Right-Handed"]}, {"Name": "Body Color", "Value": ["Black"]}, {"Name": "String Configuration", "Value": ["6 String"]}, {"Name": "Model", "Value": ["Flying V"]}, {"Name": "MPN", "Value": ["Does Not Apply"]}, {"Name": "Body Material", "Value": ["Solid Wood"]}, {"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Ibanez"]}, {"Name": "Body Type", "Value": ["Solid"]}]}, "HitCount": 407, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"ReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted", "InternationalReturnsAccepted": "ReturnsNotAccepted"}, "AutoPay": false, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 3, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "ConditionDescription": "Preowned, good working condition", "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
