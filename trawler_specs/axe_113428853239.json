{"BestOfferEnabled": false, "Description": "This is a high quality left handed guitar designed for learning how to play guitar on a Microsoft computer, laptop, or apple pc. This can be useful for all ages of players at any level. Also included is the optional foot switch and the Aerosmith song catalog program. How this works is you plug your guitar into your amp and computer with the supplied cables. Insert a learning disc of your choice. They can also be saved on your computer. Choose a lesson. On the video screen is a icon for choosing left or right handed. Select left handed. Choose where you would like to begin. When the instructor is playing the fretboard will lite up to show which string and fret to play. The videos can be slowed down so you can work your way up to regular speed. With the optional foot switch you can stop and resume the video. Also included is a Aerosmith song catalog program so you can learn your favorite songs. There are also other bands and playing styles for purchase. The guitar itself is a high quality unit that you can actually gig with. The neck is constructed very similar to the way Martin guitars are constructed. So this is not just a learning tool but a real guitar that can be used anywhere. The fret board only lights up when connected to a computer. I do not have a case or gig bag for this package but it will be carefully packaged in a box made for guitar shipping.", "ItemID": "113428853239", "EndTime": "2019-03-06T20:20:19.000Z", "StartTime": "2018-12-06T20:20:19.000Z", "ViewItemURLForNaturalSearch": "https://www.ebay.com/itm/fretlight-Series-500-Guitar-/113428853239", "ListingType": "FixedPriceItem", "Location": "Jesup, Georgia", "PaymentMethods": ["PayPal"], "GalleryURL": "https://thumbs4.ebaystatic.com/pict/1134288532398080_1.jpg", "PictureURL": ["https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/zqYAAOSwF7lcCX2N/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/gHgAAOSw1KRcCX2P/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/blQAAOSwXc9cCX2R/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/z4MAAOSwEVtcCX2T/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/6SoAAOSwzDFcCX2Y/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/LZMAAOSwESRcCX2W/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/8N8AAOSwbX1cCX2c/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/IVEAAOSw6~pcCX2a/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTYwMFgxMjAw/z/9V4AAOSwDlRcCX2V/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/xL8AAOSwtmNcCX2e/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F", "https://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/MTIwMFgxNjAw/z/wREAAOSwyYRcCX2g/$_12.JPG?set_id=880000500F"], "PostalCode": "31546", "PrimaryCategoryID": "33034", "PrimaryCategoryName": "Musical Instruments & Gear:Guitars & Basses:Electric Guitars", "Quantity": 1, "Seller": {"UserID": "dudeking1999", "FeedbackRatingStar": "Turquoise", "FeedbackScore": 219, "PositiveFeedbackPercent": 100.0}, "BidCount": 0, "ConvertedCurrentPrice": {"Value": 249.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "CurrentPrice": {"Value": 249.99, "CurrencyID": "USD"}, "ListingStatus": "Active", "QuantitySold": 0, "ShipToLocations": ["US"], "Site": "US", "TimeLeft": "P29DT23H51M4S", "Title": "fretlight Series 500 Guitar", "ItemSpecifics": {"NameValueList": [{"Name": "Brand", "Value": ["Fretlight"]}]}, "HitCount": 402, "PrimaryCategoryIDPath": "619:3858:33034", "Country": "US", "ReturnPolicy": {"Refund": "Money Back", "ReturnsWithin": "14 Days", "ReturnsAccepted": "Returns Accepted", "ShippingCostPaidBy": "Buyer"}, "AutoPay": true, "PaymentAllowedSite": [], "IntegratedMerchantCreditCardEnabled": false, "HandlingTime": 2, "ConditionID": 3000, "ConditionDisplayName": "Used", "GlobalShipping": false, "QuantitySoldByPickupInStore": 0, "NewBestOffer": false}
